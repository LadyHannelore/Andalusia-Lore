# Contributing to UK Weighted Voting System

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the UK Weighted Voting System! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üéØ Project Vision

We're building a comprehensive, research-grade voting simulation system that demonstrates how different democratic mechanisms can lead to different outcomes. Our goal is to provide tools for:

- Academic research in political science and governance
- Practical implementation in DAOs and corporate governance
- Educational demonstrations of voting system mathematics
- Policy analysis and electoral reform research

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Git for version control
- Basic understanding of voting systems and democratic principles

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/UK-Weighted-Voting-System.git
   cd UK-Weighted-Voting-System
   ```

2. **Set up Development Environment**
   ```bash
   cd voting-simulator-py
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   python quick_demo.py
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy
- `main`: Stable, production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for new features
- `feature/feature-name`: Individual feature development
- `hotfix/issue-description`: Critical bug fixes

### Making Changes

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow the coding standards below
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test Your Changes**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   python quick_demo.py  # Smoke test
   ```

4. **Commit and Push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use the PR template
   - Link any related issues
   - Ensure CI checks pass

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and returns
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Organization
```python
# Standard library imports
import json
from typing import List, Dict

# Third-party imports
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Local imports
from vote_types import VoterProfile, Candidate
from election import run_election
```

### Documentation Standards
- All public functions must have docstrings
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include type hints and examples where helpful

```python
def calculate_weights(
    profiles: List[VoterProfile],
    coeffs: WeightCoefficients,
    bounds: Dict[str, VoterProfile]
) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Calculate weighted voting power for each voter profile.
    
    Args:
        profiles: List of voter profile objects
        coeffs: Weight coefficients for each attribute
        bounds: Min/max bounds for normalization
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping voter IDs to their calculated weights
        
    Example:
        >>> profiles = [VoterProfile(id='alice', E=8, P=70, D=7, A=6, S=80)]
        >>> coeffs = WeightCoefficients(wE=0.2, wP=0.2, wD=0.2, wA=0.2, wS=0.2)
        >>> weights = calculate_weights(profiles, coeffs, bounds)
        >>> weights['alice']
        0.642
    """
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure
```

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_profiles.json
```

### Writing Tests
- Use pytest framework
- Aim for >90% code coverage
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Use descriptive test names

```python
def test_ranked_choice_elimination_with_tied_candidates():
    """Test that tied candidates are eliminated alphabetically."""
    # Test implementation here
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=voting_simulator_py

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_election.py

# Run tests matching pattern
python -m pytest -k "test_weighted"
```
