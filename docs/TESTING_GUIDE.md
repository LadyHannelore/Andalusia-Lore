# 🧪 Web Interface Testing Guide

## ✅ **Fixed Issue: Real-time Election Updates**

The ranked choice election now properly updates in the web browser in real-time, showing each round as it progresses.

### **What Was Fixed:**
- ❌ **Before**: Election ran in terminal with `time.sleep()`, web interface only showed final results
- ✅ **After**: Election runs in background thread, web interface shows real-time round updates

---

## 🔧 **Technical Changes Made:**

### **1. New Election Function**
Added `run_election_web()` in `election.py`:
- No blocking `time.sleep()` calls
- Instant execution for web interface
- Same algorithm, optimized for web

### **2. Timed Election Endpoint**
Added `/api/run-ranked-choice-timed` in `app.py`:
- Runs election in background thread
- Updates `simulation_state` with each round
- Allows real-time progress monitoring

### **3. Progress Monitoring API**
Added `/api/election-progress` endpoint:
- Returns current round number
- Provides intermediate results
- Shows completion status

### **4. Enhanced Frontend**
Updated `ranked_choice.html`:
- Real-time progress polling every 1 second
- Dynamic round display as election progresses
- Visual progress bar and status updates
- Current round highlighting

---

## 🧪 **How to Test:**

### **1. Start the Application**
```bash
cd voting-simulator-py
python app.py
```

### **2. Open Ranked Choice Page**
Go to: http://localhost:5000/ranked-choice

### **3. Test Real-time Updates**
1. **Select round duration** (try 5 seconds for good visibility)
2. **Click "Start Election"**
3. **Watch real-time updates**:
   - ✅ Status text shows "Round X in progress..."
   - ✅ Progress bar advances
   - ✅ Round cards appear one by one
   - ✅ Current round highlighted in yellow
   - ✅ Eliminated candidates shown in gray
4. **See final results**:
   - ✅ Winner announcement appears
   - ✅ All rounds displayed
   - ✅ Charts become available

### **4. Verify Web vs Terminal**
- **Web Interface**: Shows rounds progressively as they happen
- **Terminal**: Still shows detailed election progress (for debugging)
- **Both**: Use the same underlying voting logic

## 📊 **Expected Behavior:**

### **During Election:**
```
Round 1 in progress...  [Progress: 20%]
